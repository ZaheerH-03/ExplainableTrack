# Ultralytics BoT-SORT Tracker Configuration
tracker_type: botsort  # Tracker backend: botsort|bytetrack

# --- Tracking Thresholds ---
track_high_thresh: 0.65  # First-stage match threshold; raise for cleaner tracks, lower to keep more
track_low_thresh: 0.1  # Second-stage threshold for low-score matches; balances recovery vs drift
new_track_thresh: 0.6  # Start a new track if no match ≥ this; higher reduces false tracks
track_buffer: 200  # Frames to keep lost tracks alive; higher handles occlusion, increases ID switches risk
match_thresh: 0.85  # Association similarity threshold (IoU/cost); tune with detector quality
fuse_score: true  # Fuse detection score with motion/IoU for matching; stabilizes weak detections

# --- BoT-SORT Specifics ---
gmc_method: sparseOptFlow  # Global motion compensation: sparseOptFlow|orb|ecc|sift|none
proximity_thresh: 0.5  # Min IoU to consider tracks proximate for ReID; higher is stricter
appearance_thresh: 0.6  # Min appearance similarity for ReID; raise to avoid identity swaps

# --- ReID Configuration ---
with_reid: true  # Enable ReID model use; needs extra model and compute
model: auto  # ReID model name/path; "auto" uses detector features if available
